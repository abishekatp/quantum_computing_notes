# Quantum Computation

This directory will contain my notes that are related to Quantum computation. My main reference has been this freely available textbook and video content in the [IBM Qiskit](https://learning.quantum-computing.ibm.com/course/basics-of-quantum-information/single-systems) created by the Qiskit team and many other contributors. 

> **Important:**\
> So most of the content will be redundent from the Qiskit textbook. So you will be better off if you follow the qiskit textbook itself. I have tried explaining in some places in my own way, so if you don't understand some part in the qiskit textbook, then you can refer this notes to get different perspective on those topics.
>
> **Why?** \
> I understand things better when I try to explain them to others and ask question in the process of learning. That's why you can see that in these notes most of the headings will be questions. This way of writing is an intentional one. I think asking questions while learning something will make those topics more clear to us
